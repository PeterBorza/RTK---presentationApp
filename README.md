This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

It is my first project using RTK, some of my ideas are brought to screen, studying purposes only.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run all
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
This app is using json-server, fetching data from two separate paths.<br />

[http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006) for utilities gas/light,<br />
[http://localhost:5010](http://localhost:5010) for bubbles/colorSets.<br />

Running this command will fetch all data at startup for you !!!

```
npm run startall
```

Will run with concurrently, starting up the application as well as the data ports.

```
 npm start
```
